# Paper-Storage

Small and simple project using web tech + bootstrap to create a web app for a table, which data would be populated from a JSON or TXT file. Support for crud operations will only be done with JSON, because using JS to create and download files in the browser is a security hazzard. Might experiment with this on asp.net.
